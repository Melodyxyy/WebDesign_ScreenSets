# WebDesign_ScreenSets
 A website design project encompassing login, registration, and individual center interface designs.

 # Installation Guide

## 1. Create site in Gigya console
NOTE: (You can skip this step if you already have a site configured and the API Key ready to use.)

- Access your Gigya Console from https://console.gigya.com with your credentials.

- If you have site creation capabilities, on the main screen, click on Create Site.

- Add basic data for the site, including site domain, description, and datacenter to be used. Use the nearest one from your location in case of doubts, and click OK.

- Click over the Screensets tab to generate a first default set of screensets (starting with Default-ScreensetName)

- You're done here.

## 2. Demo app Installation
Now that we have a site in Gigya, we can include it in a web project. To do it:

- Download or clone the project into your web folder.


- Open the file config/site.json and look for the apiKey parameter, and substitute the sample API Key provided by default with your own value.

- Enjoy!

## 3. Next steps
Once you have the site working, it's time to go deeper reading the Basic Guide, where you will be able to adapt the site to your needs.
